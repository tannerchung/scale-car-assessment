# AI-Powered Auto Insurance Claims Assessment System

This application demonstrates a real-time, AI-driven system for assessing auto insurance claims, providing damage detection, cost estimation, and automated approval workflows.

## üöÄ Features

- **Damage Detection & Classification**: AI vision model identifies, classifies, and assesses vehicle damage severity
- **Cost Estimation**: Generates repair cost breakdowns based on detected damage and regional factors
- **Confidence Scoring**: Implements a tiered review system based on AI confidence levels
- **Historical Comparison**: Compares estimates with similar past claims
- **Adjuster Dashboard**: User-friendly interface for claim management and review
- **Multi-step Upload Process**: Guided workflow from photo upload to assessment results

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto-claims-assessment.git
cd auto-claims-assessment
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: TailwindCSS for styling
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **Image Processing**: Client-side processing with browser APIs
- **Data Management**: React Context for state management
- **Visualization**: Custom React components for data visualization
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent UI icons

### Data Flow

1. User uploads a vehicle damage photo
2. The system processes the image through AI vision models (simulated in this prototype)
3. AI analysis produces:
   - Vehicle identification
   - Damage assessment with severity classification
   - Affected areas with confidence scores
   - Repair cost estimates based on regional factors
   - Historical comparison with similar claims
4. Results are displayed with appropriate visualization
5. Claims are stored in application state (would be persisted to a database in production)

## üß† AI Implementation

This prototype simulates the AI processing aspect for demonstration purposes, but in a production environment would implement:

1. **Computer Vision Models**: For vehicle identification and damage detection
   - Object detection to identify vehicle components
   - Damage classification (scratches, dents, structural damage)
   - Vehicle make/model recognition

2. **Cost Estimation Models**:
   - Trained on historical repair data
   - Region-specific cost factors
   - Labor and parts cost calculation

3. **Confidence Scoring**:
   - Multi-factor analysis of image quality, damage complexity
   - Automated routing to appropriate review level
   - Fraud detection indicators

## üîÑ Routing Logic

The application implements an intelligent routing system based on confidence scores:

- **High Confidence (90%+)**: Auto-approval (< 1 minute)
- **Medium Confidence (80-90%)**: Quick human review (~10 minutes)
- **Low Confidence (<80%)**: Detailed human review (~25 minutes)
- **Complex Cases**: Specialist review (structural damage, multiple areas)

## üìä Dashboard Analytics

The metrics page provides insights into system performance:
- Processing time reduction
- Auto-approval rates
- Adjuster productivity
- Decision and cost estimation accuracy
- Customer satisfaction

## üîç Design Explanation

### Tool Selection

I chose React with TypeScript and TailwindCSS for this prototype because:

1. **Development Speed**: React's component-based architecture allows for rapid UI development, while TailwindCSS enables quick styling without writing custom CSS.

2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures robust code with fewer runtime errors, particularly valuable for complex data structures like insurance claims.

3. **Scalability**: The component architecture enables easy extension and maintenance as the application grows.

4. **Performance**: React's virtual DOM ensures efficient updates when handling large data sets of claims.

5. **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling with Vite for fast builds and hot module replacement.

### AI Logic Implementation

In a production environment, the AI logic would be implemented as follows:

1. **Image Processing Pipeline**:
   - Preprocessing to normalize lighting and perspective
   - Vehicle detection and segmentation
   - Damage area identification with bounding boxes

2. **Confidence Scoring**:
   - Multi-factor scoring including image quality, detection confidence, and damage complexity
   - Risk assessment based on cost anomalies and historical patterns

3. **Decision Making**:
   - Rule-based workflow routing based on confidence thresholds
   - Human-in-the-loop for complex or uncertain cases

The prototype simulates these processes with mock data to demonstrate the user experience and workflow.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

Given more time and resources, I would implement:

1. **Backend Integration**:
   - Connect to actual AI models via AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud Vision
   - Implement real-time processing with WebSockets for status updates

2. **Database Storage**:
   - PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for claim persistence
   - Redis for caching frequently accessed data

3. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control for adjusters, managers, and admins
   - OAuth integration for enterprise SSO

4. **Enhanced Analytics**:
   - Trend analysis for claims patterns
   - Adjuster performance metrics
   - ROI calculation for AI-assisted vs. manual processing

5. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - Native app wrapper with React Native 
   - Camera integration for direct capture of damage photos

6. **Machine Learning Improvements**:
   - Continuous learning from adjuster corrections
   - A/B testing of different confidence thresholds
   - Model retraining based on regional differences
